# EmailSpamClassification-usingR
This report presents a study on email spam classification using various machine learning models. The dataset used contains 5172 observations with 3000 variables representing word counts and 2 additional variables for email ID and spam/non-spam label.
The project involved data cleaning, feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and applying three classification models: Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and XGBoost. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Key Findings:

XGBoost achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 97.42%, precision of 96.42%, recall of 94.73%, and an F1-score of 95.57%.
Random Forest and SVM performed similarly, with around 95% accuracy and comparable precision, recall, and F1-scores.

Recommendations:

Model selection should be based on computational resources, interpretability requirements, and application-specific needs.
Ensemble methods combining the strengths of multiple models could potentially improve overall performance.
Further validation on real-world data and exploration of additional techniques are suggested.

The report highlights the effectiveness of data mining models in filtering spam emails and provides insights for network security and email communication systems.
